# MMSP-MoodApp
This project is owned by the <a href="https://mmsp.unimib.it/">MultiMedia Signal Processing (MMSP) Laboratory</a>, a research group of the <a href="https://www.disco.unimib.it/en">Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication</a> at the <a href="https://en.unimib.it/">University of Milano-Bicocca</a>.

The web application has been developed by our master's student, Elena Brambilla, in collaboration with our PhD student, Claudia Rabaioli, and our bachelor's student, Gabriele Angioletti, under the supervision of our laboratory head, Professor Francesca Gasparini.

This web app is part of our research on mood, conducted by our team members Aurora Saibene, Claudia Rabaioli, and Francesca Gasparini. We are working together with the Haptics and Virtual Prototyping Lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, alongside Riccardo Giussani, Nicolò Dozio, and Professor Francesco Ferrise.
